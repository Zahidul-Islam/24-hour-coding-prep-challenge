# 24-hour-coding-prep-challenge

## Day 1 (January 4, 2020)

I started my 24-hour coding Interview prep challenge at 10:00 AM. I have a perfect cup of coffee and I am ready to crack the coding interview prep. Here are the topics I will go through today.

- [Arrays and Strings](arrays-and-strings.md)
- [Linked Lists](linked-lists.md)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Search

I will study the topics, document all useful resources, solve 5/10 problems in each topic and update the community every 2 hours.
